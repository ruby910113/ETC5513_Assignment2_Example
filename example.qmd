## Introduction

This is a simple Quarto file.

This line was added in both branches to demonstrate a merge conflict.

## Plot Example

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-comparison
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of cumulative excess deaths per 100,000 people across selected countries (2020â€“2023)."

# Read csv
world_excess <- read_csv("data/estimated-cumulative-excess-deaths-per-100000-people-during-covid-19.csv")

# Filter and clean
selected <- c("Taiwan", "Japan", "South Korea", "China", "Philippines", "Vietnam")

cleaned_excess_data <- world_excess %>%
  filter(Entity %in% selected) %>%
  mutate(Day = ymd(Day)) %>%
  filter(Day >= as.Date("2020-01-01") & Day <= as.Date("2023-12-31")) %>%
  rename(
    excess_deaths = 
      `Cumulative excess deaths per 100,000 people (central estimate)`
  ) %>%
  drop_na(excess_deaths) %>%
  select(Day, Entity, excess_deaths)

## Plot for Comparison Across Neighboring Countries
ggplot(cleaned_excess_data, aes(x = Day, y = excess_deaths, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Excess Deaths Comparison: Taiwan and Neighboring Countries",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Excess Deaths per 100,000",
    color = "Country"
  )
```
